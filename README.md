# gWiris
Editing the default WIRIS versions. Batchfile 100%

## Project
This app is useful for somebody who runs WIRIS fluently and carries it in his portable disk.

What this app does is deleting some useless files + incrementing default WIRIS' performance by adding more used RAM to the config files.

## Source
Every single piece of code in this file is coded by me. Every other code is owned by the app creator.

## Compatibility & Enviroment
You only need a valid WIRIS location for this file to work. It'll automatically find a WIRIS enviroment and stick to it. This app is tested under WIRIS Desktop CAD but should work under any other. It supports XP and below (or suppossed) and works fine on a USB.

## License
Being updated. 

## Instalation & Download
To install it just put it inside the WIRIS default folder. Run it and it'll automatically modify everything.
