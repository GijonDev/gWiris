# gWiris
Editing the default WIRIS versions. Batchfile 100%

## Project
This file is useful for somebody who runs WIRIS regularly and sometimes needs to work outside home.
This file deletes some useless files + incrementing default WIRIS' performance by adding more used RAM to the config files.

## Source
Every single piece of code in this file is coded by me. Every other code is owned by the app creators. You can take a look at gWiris' code right now.

## Compatibility & Enviroment
You only need a valid WIRIS location for this file to work. It'll automatically find a WIRIS enviroment and stick to it. Tested under WIRIS Desktop CAD but should work under any other. It supports XP and below and works fine on a USB.

## License
gWiris is running under BSD-3 Clause license.

## Instalation
To install it just put it inside the WIRIS default folder. Run it and it'll automatically modify everything.
