# gWiris

## Project
This file deletes some useless files + increments default WIRIS' performance by adding more used RAM to the config files. Duplicating WIRIS regular performance is common.
### It needs java to run!

## Compatibility & Enviroment
You only need a valid WIRIS location for this file to work. It'll automatically find a WIRIS enviroment and stick to it. It's tested under WIRIS Desktop CAD but should work under any other. Windows XP (should) be supported.

## License
gWiris is running under BSD-3 Clause license.

## Install
To install just put it in the WIRIS root folder. Run it and it will automatically modify everything.

## Uninstall
To uninstall and return WIRIS to its original state, run uninstall.bat in the same folder as gWiris. Please note that deleted files such as manuals will not be recovered, so if you're trying to run WIRIS vanilla, you should reinstall everything from scratch.
