# gWiris
Editing the default WIRIS versions using batch scripts.

## Project
This file deletes some useless files + increments default WIRIS' performance by adding more used RAM to the config files. Duplicating WIRIS regular performance is common.

## Compatibility & Enviroment
You only need a valid WIRIS location for this file to work. It'll automatically find a WIRIS enviroment and stick to it. It's tested under WIRIS Desktop CAD but should work under any other. It supports XP and below and works fine on any type of USB.

## License
gWiris is running under BSD-3 Clause license.

## Install
To install just put it inside the WIRIS default folder. Run it and it'll automatically modify everything.
